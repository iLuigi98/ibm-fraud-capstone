# Data setup (local only)

We are not syncing large datasets through GitHub or DVC yet.

Place the dataset files here on your machine:

data/raw/
  HI-Small_Trans.csv
  HI-Small_accounts.csv
  HI-Small_Patterns.txt

Optional: use LI-Small files if you have them locally.

Do not commit any raw or processed data to git.
